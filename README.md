# Used_Cars_Prediction_Using_ML
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using linear regression and polynomial regression models. 
The dataset used in this project contains information about various factors such as make, model, fuel type, location, color, owner, seller type etc which can potentially influence the price of a used car.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
1. Make: The brand or manufacturer of the car.
2. Model: The model of the car.
3. Year: Manufacturing year of the car.
4. Kilometer: Kilometer driven by the car.
5. Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., petrol, diesel).
6. Transmission: It refers to the mechanism that transfers power from the engine to the wheels, allowing the driver to control the speed and direction of the vehicle.
7. Location: The location where the car is being sold.
8. Color: The color of the car.
9. Owner: The number of previous owners of the car.
10. Seller Type: The type of seller (e.g., individual, dealer).
11. Engine: It represents the total volume of all the cylinders in the engine.
12. Max Power: Maximum power of the car given in bhp.
13. Max Torque: Maximum torque generated by the car.
14. Drivetrain: It refers the system that transfers power from the engine to the wheels, enabling the vehicle to move.
15. Length: Length of the car.
16. Width: Width of the car.
17. Height: Height of the car.
18. Seating Capacity: Total seats in the car.
19. Fuel Tank Capacity: Fuel tank capacity in liters.
20. Price: The target variable, representing the price of the used car.
# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:
1. Python 3.0 or above
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Statsmodels
6. Matplotlib
# Usage
- Ensure that you have the dataset available in the project directory. (available in reposatory)
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE of your choice.
- Open the "used_cars_price_prediction.ipynb" file.
- Run the notebook cell by cell to execute the code and see the results.
# Models and Evaluation
- This project includes two regression models: linear regression and polynomial regression. The models are trained and evaluated as follows:
- Data preprocessing: The categorical columns (Make, Fuel Type, Location, Color, Owner, Seller Type) are transformed into one-hot encoded features using the ColumnTransformer from Scikit-learn.
- Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.
- Linear Regression: A linear regression model is fitted to the training data and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared score. The model is then used to predict car prices on the testing data.
- Polynomial Regression: A polynomial regression model is fitted to the training data by transforming the features into polynomial terms. The model is evaluated using the same metrics and used to predict car prices on the testing data.
- Model Comparison: The performance of the linear regression and polynomial regression models is compared based on the evaluation metrics.
